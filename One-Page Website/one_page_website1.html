                                    <li>Combine the Spice Mix ingredients in a bowl. Sprinkle 4 teaspoons over the beef and pat so it sticks.</li>

                                    <li>Turn the stove down to medium heat.If the pot looks dry, add more olive oil.</li>

                                    <li>Put the lid on, bring to a simmer then turn the heat down so it is bubbling gently, not rapidly.</li>

                                    <li>Remove the beef from the saue, shred into pieces</li>
                                    <li>Leave the sauce to simmer with the lid off for 10 to 15 minutes to reduce and thicken to your taste. Adjust salt to taste.<strong>Optional:</strong>puree with a stick blender to make it smooth.</li>
                                    <li>Toss the beef back into the sauce.</li>
                                    <li>Transfer the beef into a large dish and serve.</li>
                                    <li>To make tacos, serve the beef with warmed small tortillas ( of your choosing),avocado slices,Pico de Gallo, shredded cheese, sour cream, lime wedges, and extra cilantro/ coriander leaves.</li>

                                    <ol class="toggle-content ingredients">
                                    <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat broiler. Arrange bread slices on baking sheet and drizzle first sides with 2 tablespoons oil; flip slices and drizzle with 2 more tablespoons oil. Broil the bread until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Set aside.</li>
                                    <li>In a large bowl, use your finger to crush tomatoes until tomato pieces are no larger than 1/2 inch; set aside.</li>
                                    <li>Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste, oregano, salt, and pepper flakes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until rust-colored, about 2 minutes. Add basil leaves and cook until wilted, about 30 seconds. Stir in reserved crushed tomatoes and bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
                                    <li> Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. The sauce should be thick enough that a spatula should leaves trail in the sauce that slowly fills in behind it, but the sauce should still move when the skillet is shaken.</li>
                                    <li>Remove skillet from heat and let sit for 2 minutes to cool slightly. In a small bowl, crack 1 egg. Using a rubber spatula or large spoon, clear a 2-inch-diameter well in sauce. Immediately pour in the cracked egg. (The well will hold yolk in place but may not fully contain egg white; this is ok.) Repeat with remaining eggs, evenly spacing the remaining 7 eggs in total around the skillet (7 around perimeter and 1 in the center).</li>
                                    <li>Season each egg lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, cover, and cook, reducing heat as needed to maintain gentle simmer, until yolks film over, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, covered, until whites are just set (if skillet is shaken lightly, each egg should jiggle), 1 to 2 minutes longer for slightly runny yolks or 3 to 4 minutes for soft-cooked yolks.</li>
                                    <li>Off heat sprinkle with Parmesan and chopped basil and drizzle with extra oil. Serve immediately with toasted bread.</li>

                                <li>1 pound (about 4 cups) fresh or frozen fruit, such as strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries, washed and chopped</li>
                                <li>¾ cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste and fruit sweetness)</li>
                                <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                                <li>Pinch of salt (optional, for flavor enhancement) </li>
                                <h1> Ingredients Pancakes:</h1>
                                <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                                <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                                <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                                <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
                                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                                <li>1 large egg</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3> Intructions:</h3>
                                <ol class="toggle-content ingredients">
                                <li>Prepare the fruit: Wash the fruit thoroughly. Hull and quarter large fruits like strawberries, or pit and chop stone fruits like peaches. Combine the prepared fruit, sugar, and lemon juice in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan.Macerate (optional): Stir the mixture and let it sit for at least 15 minutes, or up to overnight, to help coax the juices out of the fruit.</li>
                                <li>Cook the jam: Place the pot over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Once dissolved, increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a full, rolling boil.</li>
                                <li>Mash and simmer: As it begins to boil, mash the fruit with a potato masher to your desired consistency. Reduce the heat slightly to maintain a steady simmer and continue cooking, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, for about 15–25 minutes until the jam has thickened.</li>
                                <li>Test for doneness: Remove the chilled plate from the freezer. Spoon a small amount of jam onto the plate and return it to the fridge for a minute or two. Drag your finger through the jam; if the path remains clear and the jam wrinkles, it is ready. If it runs back together, continue cooking for a few more minutes and retest.</li>
                                <li>Jar and store: Turn off the heat and carefully ladle the hot jam into your clean jars, leaving about ¼ inch of space at the top. Let the jam cool completely at room temperature before sealing with the lids. Store the jam in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks, or freeze it for up to 1 year. </li>
                                <h3>Instructions: Pancake</h3>
                                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
                                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>

                                <li>In a small bowl, stir together the water, sugar, and the yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy.</li>
                                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, place the flour and salt. Mix on medium speed until combined. Add the yeast mixture and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Mix on medium speed until the dough forms into a ball around the hook, 5 to 6 minutes. If the dough is too dry to form a ball, add water ½ tablespoon at a time until the mixture comes together. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
                                <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth ball.</li>
                                <li>Brush a large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon of olive oil and place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
                                <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Stretch to fit a 14-inch pizza pan or similar.</li>
                                <li>Top and bake according to the pizza recipe you are using, typically 10 to 13 minutes in a 500°F oven, or until the crust is browned.</li>
                                <li>Note: This recipe can be made with half all-purpose flour and half-white whole wheat flour for a more whole grain option</li>
