	  <h2> Why coffee is amazing </h2>
	  <p>Coffee is valued for its rich antioxidant content and is associated with several health benefits, including improved alertness, better athletic performance, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, and protection against certain diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and liver disease. However, excessive caffeine intake can cause side effects like anxiety, and coffee may worsen symptoms for some people with gastrointestinal issues. </p>
