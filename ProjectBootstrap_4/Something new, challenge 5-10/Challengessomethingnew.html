                    <p class="hover-paragraph">Color theory is the study of how colors interact and how to use them to create specific visual effects and evoke emotions. It's a practical guide for mixing colors and is based on the principles of the color wheel, which shows the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Color theory is used by artists and designers to choose color combinations that create visual harmony and convey a specific mood or message.</p>

                                <td>In visual experiences, harmony is something that is pleasing to the eye. It engages the viewer and it creates an inner sense of order, a balance in the visual experience. When something is not harmonious, it's either boring or chaotic. At one extreme is a visual experience that is so bland that the viewer is not engaged. The human brain will reject under-stimulating information. At the other extreme is a visual experience that is so overdone, so chaotic that the viewer can't stand to look at it. The human brain rejects what it cannot organize, what it cannot understand. The visual task requires that we present a logical structure. Color harmony delivers visual interest and a sense of order.
                                    In summary, extreme unity leads to under-stimulation, extreme complexity leads to over-stimulation. Harmony is a dynamic equilibrium.</td>
